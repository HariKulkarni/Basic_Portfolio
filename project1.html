    <h1>Musical Chord Identification</h1>

    <p>
      This project focuses on identifying piano chords using Machine Learning
      and Deep Learning techniques.
    </p>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Machine Learning</li>
      <li>Deep Learning (CNN)</li>
      <li>NumPy, OpenCV</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>
      Audio recordings were converted into waveform images using Discrete
      Fourier Transform (DFT). Deep learning models were trained and evaluated
      using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
